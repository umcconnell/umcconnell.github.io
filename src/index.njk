    <h1>ðŸ‘‹ Hi</h1>

    <p>
        This is my own personal website and blog on the endless expanses of the
        internet. Every once in a while, I try to write about my ideas and
        different technical topics, mostly related to programming. Feel free to
        look around and explore...
    </p>

    <p>All views and opinions expressed in this blog are my own.</p>
